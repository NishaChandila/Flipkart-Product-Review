# Customer Sentiment Analysis Using Word Clouds

In this project, we aim to analyze customer sentiment from Flipkart product reviews by visualizing the most frequently mentioned words in both positive and negative feedback. By generating a word cloud from these reviews, we can uncover what customers appreciate about the products and identify areas for improvement. The word cloud serves as a powerful tool for transforming raw text data into insights that reflect customer experiences.

## Dataset Overview

Our dataset contains **189,874 rows** and **5 columns**, which include:

- **ProductName**: The name of the product being reviewed.
- **Price**: The price of the product at the time of review.
- **Rate**: The rating given by the customer (on a scale of 1 to 5).
- **Review**: The detailed feedback provided by the customer.
- **Summary**: A brief summary of the review, used to generate the word cloud.

The word cloud is created by analyzing the **Summary** column, capturing the most frequent and impactful words that reflect customer sentiment.

## Word Cloud Insights

The word cloud showcases key sentiments from the reviews. Words like **"class product," "simple," "awesome," "recommended,"** and **"mind blowing"** stand out in larger fonts, representing positive feedback from customers. These words highlight qualities such as product quality, ease of use, and overall satisfaction.

On the other hand, words like **"bad"** and **"poor quality"** appear smaller, representing negative sentiments. These terms provide insights into the aspects of the products that customers feel need improvement.

For me, this word cloud is not just a data visualization—it’s a reflection of customer experiences, offering a clear view of what people value and where businesses can do better. It underscores the importance of listening to both positive and negative feedback to improve products and foster greater customer satisfaction.

## Recommendation

Based on the insights from the word cloud, it's clear that customers highly value product quality, simplicity, and overall satisfaction. To further enhance customer experience, businesses should focus on addressing common complaints related to poor quality and reliability. Listening to both positive and negative feedback allows for continuous product improvement and helps build stronger customer loyalty.
